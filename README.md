The Qualifying Evidence Matrix (QEM) standard defines a minimal and interoperable way to encode **verifiable evidence** derived from rule-based evaluations.

QEM is designed for situations where analysis results may be produced by proprietary or opaque algorithms, but where the **availability of underlying evidence must remain auditable, reproducible, and independently verifiable**.
